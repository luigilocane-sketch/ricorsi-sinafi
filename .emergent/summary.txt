<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested to create a pixel-perfect clone of the website .

This was followed by several feature requests to build a full-stack application:
- **PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
    1.  Create a full-stack application for managing legal appeals ().
    2.  Implement an admin authentication system.
    3.  Develop an admin dashboard to create, view, edit, and delete appeals.
    4.  The admin must be able to dynamically define the data fields (e.g., name, surname) and required documents (up to 10) for each new appeal, including specifying file types (PDF, JPG, PNG).
    5.  Allow admins to upload an example file for each required document to guide users.
    6.  The public-facing form must dynamically render based on the configuration of the selected appeal.
    7.  Implement functionality for admins to set deadlines and view submission statistics categorized by region.
    8.  Add a feature for admins to invite other administrators. This was implemented as a mocked system that generates a registration link.
    9.  Update the UI to include the Si.Na.Fi. logo and change a specific text phrase to riservato ai soci Si.Na.Fi..
    10. Remove the Made with Emergent badge from the UI.
    11. The completed codebase should be transferred to a GitHub repository.

**User's preferred language**: The user's primary language is **Italian**. The next agent MUST respond in Italian.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. The application allows an administrator to create and manage custom legal appeals (). Each appeal can have its own set of data fields and document requirements. A public page dynamically displays the form for users to submit their applications. The system also includes features for regional deadline management and a (mocked) admin invitation system.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user requested to transfer the entire project to a GitHub repository. The agent initiated this process using the .
-   **Status:** NONE (This is considered a meta-task, not a development one. The code transfer was the final action.)
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N/A
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** N/A
-   **User Testing Done:** N/A

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: Admin cannot delete appeals () from the dashboard. (PRIORITY: P0)
-   Issue 2: Intermittent frontend-backend connection failure. (PRIORITY: P0)

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Admin cannot delete appeals () from the dashboard.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent confirmed the backend  endpoint works correctly when tested in isolation. The agent also reviewed the frontend code in  and found no obvious syntax errors in the  function or related imports (). The issue appears to be on the frontend side.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  In , add  statements inside the  function to trace its execution (before , after confirmation, and inside the  call's  and  blocks).
        2.  Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the Network tab when the Elimina button is clicked. Check if a  request is being sent, verify its URL, headers (especially the  token), and the server's response (status code and body).
        3.  This issue is likely a symptom of Issue #2.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a critical administrative function. Fixing it will allow admins to manage the lifecycle of appeals correctly.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** Issue 2: Intermittent frontend-backend connection failure.

-   **Issue 2: Intermittent frontend-backend connection failure.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent observed through screenshots that the frontend often fails to load data, displaying Nessun Ricorso Attivo and a Frontend Preview Only banner, even when backend tests confirmed the server was running and contained data. The agent restarted servers, but the problem persisted.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Verify that the  in  is correct and accessible from within the running frontend container.
        2.  Simultaneously check the frontend browser console for network or CORS errors and the backend logs () for any incoming request failures.
        3.  Ensure the authentication token stored in  is not stale and is being correctly attached to API request headers by the service in .
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is the root cause of most user-facing problems, including Issue #1. The application is unusable without a stable connection.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   (P1) **Resolve the two pending issues:** Fix the delete functionality and stabilize the frontend-backend connection.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   (P2) **Implement real email sending:** Replace the mock admin invitation system with a real email service integration to send invitation links directly. This would involve modifying the  endpoint in .
    -   (P3) **Implement password management:** Create a feature for administrators to change their own passwords. The current credentials are hardcoded.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- The issues listed in the All Pending/In progress Issue list section cover all known unfixed problems.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn components.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), Pydantic.
-   **Database:** MongoDB with the  asynchronous driver.
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based. The token is stored in the browser's  on the frontend.

**key DB schema**
-   **ricorsi**: Stores the definition of each appeal, including , ,  (array of objects),  (array of objects), and  (dictionary).
-   **submissions**: Stores user submissions, linked to a , with submission  and a list of uploaded .
-   **admins**: Stores administrator credentials (, ).
-   **invitations**: Stores temporary tokens for new admin registration.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None. The standard React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack was used.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains all backend logic, including endpoints for appeals, submissions, admin authentication, and statistics.
-   : The main page for admins to manage appeals. Contains the non-functional Delete button.
-   : The public form that dynamically renders based on the appeal's configuration.
-   : A crucial file that centralizes all frontend API calls to the backend and attaches the auth token.
-   : Contains all client-side routing.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Frontend State Management**: The app uses component-level state () and prop drilling. For better scalability and to resolve potential state-related bugs, migrating to a global state solution (like React Context or Zustand) for auth status and shared data is recommended.

**key api endpoints**
-   : ,  (for appeals)
-   : , ,  (for a single appeal)
-   :  (for user submissions)
-   :  (for admin authentication)
-   :  (to create admin invitation links)
-   :  (to list admins)
-   :  (for regional statistics)
-   :  (for file uploads)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The highest priority is to fix the frontend-backend connection instability (Issue #2), as it is the likely root cause of the broken Delete functionality (Issue #1) and makes the app unreliable.
-   Admin credentials are hardcoded for testing: **Username:** , **Password:** .
-   The admin invitation system does **not** send emails; it generates a registration link that must be copied and shared manually.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:**
    -   The Delete Appeal functionality in the admin dashboard.
    -   The overall data-fetching connection between the frontend and backend is unstable, causing pages to load without data.
-   **Mocked:**
    -   The admin invitation system generates a link to be manually copied instead of sending an email.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   None.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES (Backend testing agent and deployment health checks were used).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** The delete appeal functionality is broken. Frontend data loading is unstable.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Admin URL:** 
-   **Username:** 
-   **Password:** 

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent did not successfully resolve the recurring bug where the Delete button in the admin dashboard fails to work. Despite multiple user reports and investigations, the root cause (likely the unstable frontend-backend connection) was not fixed.</analysis>
